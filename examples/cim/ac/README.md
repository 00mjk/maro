# Container Inventory Management Using Actor-Critic (Single-thread)

This example demonstrates the single-threaded version of the actor-critc algorithm applied to the container inventory management (CIM) scenario. The example can be run by simply executing ``main.py``. Logs generated during a run will be saved in a file named ``cim-ac.CURRENT_TIME_STAMP.log`` under the ``logs`` folder.
