# Container Inventory Management

Container inventory management (CIM) is a scenario where reinforcement learning (RL) can potentially prove useful. Three algorithms, DQN, MLP-based actor-critic and GNN-based actor-critic, are demonstrated under folders ``dqn``, ``ac`` and ``ac-gnn``, respectively. Each algorithm has a ``config`` folder which contains ``agent_config.py`` and ``training_config.py``. The former contains parameters for the underlying models and algorithm specific hyper-parameters. The latter contains parameters for the environment and the main training loop. The file ``common.py`` contains parameters and utility functions shared by some or all of these algorithms. The instructions for running these algorithms can be found in the individual ``README.md`` files under the algorithm folders.
