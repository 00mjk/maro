    The agent manager provides a unified interactive interface with the environment for RL agent(s). From

    agents, so that the whole agent manager will behave just like a single agent.

        action_shaper (ActionShaper, optional): It is responsible for converting an agent's model output to environment
            executable action. Cannot be None under Inference and TrainInference modes.
