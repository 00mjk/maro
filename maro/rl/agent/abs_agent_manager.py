    """Abstract agent manager class.

    The agent manager provides a unified interactive interface with the environment for RL agent(s). From
    the actorâ€™s perspective, it isolates the complex dependencies of the various homogeneous/heterogeneous
    agents, so that the whole agent manager will behave just like a single agent.

    Args:
        name (str): Name of agent manager.
        mode (AgentManagerMode): An ``AgentManagerNode`` enum member that indicates the role of the agent manager
            in the current process.
        agent_dict (dict): A dictionary of agents to be wrapper by the agent manager.
        experience_shaper (ExperienceShaper, optional): It is responsible for processing data in the replay buffer at
            the end of an episode.
        state_shaper (StateShaper, optional): It is responsible for converting the environment observation to model
            input.
        action_shaper (ActionShaper, optional): It is responsible for converting an agent's model output to environment
            executable action. Cannot be None under Inference and TrainInference modes.
