    The agent manager provides a unified interactive interface with the environment for RL agent(s). From
    the actorâ€™s perspective, it isolates the complex dependencies of the various homogeneous/heterogeneous
    agents, so that the whole agent manager will behave just like a single agent.

            input.
        action_shaper (Shaper, optional): It is responsible for converting an agent's model output to environment
            executable action. Cannot be None under Inference and TrainInference modes.
        experience_shaper (Shaper, optional): It is responsible for processing data in the replay buffer at
